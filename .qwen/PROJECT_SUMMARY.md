# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix rendering issues in the Oracle Certifications section of the user's GitHub profile README.md file.

## Key Knowledge

## Recent Actions

- [DONE] Fixed all file paths and URLs in the table by encoding spaces as %20
- [DONE] Updated all certification entries with proper URL encoding for badges, PDF links, and certificate images
